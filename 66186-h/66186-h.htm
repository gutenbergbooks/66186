<p class='c014'>Ibsen himself has told us, in his preface to the second
edition of <cite>The Feast at Solhoug</cite>, how the reading of
the Icelandic family-sagas suggested to him, in germ,
the theme of <cite>The Vikings at Helgeland</cite>. What he
first saw, he says, was the contrasted figures of the
two women who ultimately became Hiördis and Dagny,
together with a great banquet-scene at which an interchange
of taunts and gibes should lead to tragic
consequences. So far as one can gather from this
statement, the particular theme which he ultimately
borrowed from the <cite>Volsung-Saga</cite> had not yet entered
his mind. On the other hand, the conception of the
two women’s characters was certainly not new to him,
seeing that a similar contrast presents itself in his
very earliest work, <cite>Catilina</cite>, between the aptly-named
Furia and the gentle Aurelia; while even in <cite>Lady
Inger of Ostråt</cite> it reappears, somewhat disguised,
in the contrast between Inger Gyldenlöve and her
daughter Eline. While the scheme of <cite>The Vikings</cite>
was still entirely vague, however, fresh influences,
both of a personal and of a literary nature, intervened,
and, transposing the theme from the purely dramatic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>into the lyrical key, he produced <cite>The Feast at Solhoug</cite>.
The foster-sisters, Hiördis and Dagny became the
sisters Margit and Signe, and the banquet, instead of
being the culminating-point of the dramatic action,
became its mere background.</p>

<p class='c015'>The fact probably is that in 1855 the poet found
himself still unripe for the intense effort of dramatic
concentration involved in such a work as <cite>The Vikings</cite>.
Probably, too, he knew that neither his actors nor his
public at the Bergen Theatre were prepared to go
back to the primitive austerity of the heroic age, as it
was beginning to body itself forth in his mind. The
good Bergensers were accustomed either to French
intrigue (such as he had given them in <cite>Lady Inger</cite>), or
to Danish lyrical romanticism; and he perhaps foresaw
that the ruling taste of Bergen would be as
hard to contend against as, in the sequel, the ruling
taste of Copenhagen actually proved to be. At all
events, from whatever mingling of motives, he put
the heroic theme aside for two years, while he kept to
the key of lyrical romanticism not only in the <cite>Feast at
Solhoug</cite>, written in the summer of 1855, but also in
the very feeble <cite>Olaf Liliekrans</cite>, conceived much earlier,
but written in 1856. Not until he had left Bergen
behind him and returned to Christiania in the summer
of 1857, did the poet take up again, and rapidly work
out, the theme of <cite>The Vikings</cite>. It is almost inconceivable
that only a year should have intervened
between it and <cite>Olaf Liliekrans</cite>.</p>

<p class='c015'>Paul Botten-Hansen, perhaps Ibsen’s closest friend
of those days, has stated that <cite>The Vikings</cite> was begun
in verse. If so, the metre chosen was probably the
twelve-syllable measure of Oehlenschläger’s <cite>Balder’s
Death</cite>, supposed to represent the iambic trimeter of
the Greek dramatists. In an essay <cite>On the Heroic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>Ballad</cite>, written in Bergen in the early months of
1857, Ibsen had condemned, as a medium for the
treatment of Scandinavian themes, the iambic deca-syllable
(our blank verse) in which Oehlenschläger
had written most of his plays, and which Ibsen himself
had adopted in his early imitation of Oehlenschläger,
<cite>The Hero’s Grave</cite>. Blank verse Ibsen regarded
as “entirely foreign” to Norwegian-Danish prosody,
and, moreover, a product of Christian influences;
whereas pagan antiquity, if treated in verse at all,
ought to be treated in the pagan measure of the
Greeks. At the same time we find him expressing a
doubt whether Oehlenschläger’s <cite>Hakon Jarl</cite> might
not have been just as poetic in prose as in verse—a
doubt which clearly shows in what direction his
thoughts were turning. It must be regarded as a
great mercy that he abandoned the iambic trimeter,
which, in Oehlenschläger’s hands, was nothing but an
unrhymed Alexandrine with the cæsura displaced.</p>

<p class='c015'>This same essay <cite>On the Heroic Ballad</cite> throws a
curious light on the difficulties which occasioned the
long delay between the conception and the execution
of <cite>The Vikings</cite>. He lays it down that “the heroic
ballad is much better fitted than the saga for dramatic
treatment. The saga is a great, cold, rounded and
self-contained epos, essentially objective, and exclusive
of all lyricism.... If, now, the poet is to extract
a dramatic work from this epic material, he must
necessarily bring into it a foreign, a lyrical, element;
for the drama is well known to be a higher blending
of the lyric and the epos.” This “well-known”
dogma he probably accepted from the German æstheticians
with whom, about this time, he seems to have
busied himself. A little further on, he adds that the
accommodating prosody of the ballads gives room for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>“many freedoms which are of great importance to
dramatic dialogue,” and consequently prophesies a
great future for the drama drawn from this source.
It was a luckless prophecy. He himself, though apparently
he little guessed it, had done his last work in
lyrical romance; and though it has survived, sporadically,
in Danish and even in German literature, it can
count but few masterpieces during the past half-century.
Perhaps, however, Hauptmann’s <cite>Sunken Bell</cite>
might be taken as justifying Ibsen’s forecast.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c016'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>It must have been very soon after this essay was
published (May 1857) that Ibsen discovered how to
impose dramatic form upon the epic material of the
sagas, without dragging in any foreign lyrical element.
He suddenly saw his way, it would seem, to reproducing
in dialogue the terse, unvarnished prose of the
sagas themselves, eloquent in reticence rather than in
rhetorical or lyrical abundance.</p>

<p class='c015'>Had he, or had he not, in the meantime read
Björnson’s one-act play, <cite>Between the Battles</cite>? It was
not produced until October 27, 1857, by which time
<cite>The Vikings</cite> must have been almost, if not quite,
finished. But Ibsen may have seen it in manuscript
several months earlier, and it may have put him on
the track of the form in which to cast his saga-material.
The style of <cite>The Vikings</cite> is incomparably
firmer, purer, more homogeneous and clear-cut than
that of <cite>Between the Battles</cite>; but Björnson’s mediæval
comedietta (it is really little more) may quite well
have given Ibsen a valuable impulse towards the
adaptation of the saga-style to drama. The point, however,
is of little moment. It is much more important to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>note that while Ibsen was writing <cite>The Vikings</cite> Björnson
was writing his peasant-idyll <cite>Synnöve Solbakken</cite>; so that
these two corner-stones of modern Norwegian literature
were laid, to all intents and purposes, simultaneously.</p>

<p class='c015'>In an autobiographic letter to Peter Hansen,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c016'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
written in 1870, Ibsen mentions this play very
briefly: “<cite>The Vikings at Helgeland</cite> I wrote whilst I
was engaged to be married. For Hiördis I had the
same model as I took afterwards for Svanhild in
<cite>Love’s Comedy</cite>.” More noteworthy is his preface to a
German translation of the play, published in 1876.
It runs as follows:</p>

<p class='c015'>“In issuing a German translation of one of my
earlier dramatic works, it may not be superfluous to
remark that I have taken the material of this play,
not from the <cite>Nibelungenlied</cite>, but in part—and in part
only—from a kindred Scandinavian source, the
<cite>Volsung-Saga</cite>. More essentially, however, my poem
may be said to be founded upon the various Icelandic
family-sagas, in which it often seems that the titanic
conditions and occurrences of the <cite>Nibelungenlied</cite> and
the <cite>Volsung-Saga</cite> have simply been reduced to human
dimensions. Hence I think we may conclude that the
situations and events depicted in these two documents
were typically characteristic of our common Germanic
life in the earliest historical times. If this view be
justified, it disposes of the reproach that in the present
drama our national mythic world is brought down to a
lower plane than that to which it belongs. The idealised,
and in some degree impersonal, myth-figures are
exceedingly ill-adapted for representation on the stage
of to-day; and, however this may be, it was not my
aim to present our mythic world, but simply our life
in primitive times.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>The reasoning of this passage does not seem very
cogent; but it expresses clearly enough the design
which the poet proposed to himself. Before discussing
the merits of the play, however, I may as well complete
the outline of its external history.</p>

<p class='c015'>Part of that external history is written by Ibsen
himself, in letters to the Christiania Press of the day.
In the autumn of 1857, he presented the play to the
Christiania Theatre, then occupied by a Danish
company, under Danish management. After a long
delay, he ascertained that it had been accepted and
would be produced in March 1858. He then proposed
to consult with the manager as to the casting of the
piece, but found that that functionary had no clear conception
of either the plot or the characters, and therefore
left him a couple of months in which to study it.
At the end of that time the poet again reminded the
potentate of his existence, and learned that “since the
economic status and prospects of the theatre did not
permit of its paying fees for original works,” the proposed
production could not take place. Ibsen hints that,
had the choice been offered him, he would have consented
to the performance of the piece without fee or
reward. As the choice was not offered him, he regarded
the whole episode as a move in the anti-national policy
of the Danish management; and the controversy which
arose out of the incident doubtless contributed to the
nationalisation of the Christiania Theatre—the supersession
of Danish by Norwegian managers, actors and
authors—which took place during the succeeding
decade.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the meantime, almost simultaneously with the
rejection of the play by the Christiania Theatre, it
was rejected by the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen.
The director, J. L. Heiberg, was then regarded as an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>autocrat in the æsthetic world; and his report on <cite>The
Vikings</cite> is now a curiosity of literature. He declared
that nothing was so “monotonous, tiresome and
devoid of all poetry” as the Icelandic family-sagas;
he could not endure their “wildness and rawness” on
the stage; the saga style, as reproduced by Ibsen,
seemed to him “mannered and affected”; and he
concluded his judgment in these terms: “A Norwegian
theatre will scarcely take its rise from such experiments,
and the Danish theatre has fortunately no
need for them.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The play was published in April 1858 as a supplement
to a Christiania illustrated paper, the author
receiving an “honorarium” of something less than
£7. On November 24, 1858, it was produced at the
little “Norwegian Theatre” in Christiania, of which
the poet was then director. At the Bergen Theatre it
was produced in 1859, at the Christiania Theatre (by
that time pretty well Norwegianised) in 1861. It
did not make its way to Copenhagen and Stockholm
until 1875. In 1876 it was acted at the Court
Theatres of Munich and Dresden, and at the Vienna
Burgtheater. Thenceforward it was pretty frequently
seen on the German stage; but it does not seem to
have reached Berlin (Deutsches Theater) until 1890.
In 1892 it was produced in Moscow. The only production
in the English language of which any account
has reached me took place in 1903 at the Imperial
Theatre, London, when Miss Ellen Terry appeared as
Hiördis and Mr. Oscar Asche as Sigurd. The scenery
and dresses were designed by Miss Terry’s son,
Mr. Gordon Craig.</p>

<p class='c015'>It would need not merely an essay, but a volume, to
discuss the relation of <cite>The Vikings</cite> to its mythic material,
and to other modern treatments of that material—Friedrich
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>Hebbel’s <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Die Nibelungen</cite></span>, Richard Wagner’s
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Ring der Nibelungen</cite></span>, &amp;c. The poet’s actual indebtedness
to the <cite>Volsung-Saga</cite> is well summarised by Henrik
Jæger in his “Life of Ibsen”: “Like Sigurd
Fafnir’s-bane,” he says, “Sigurd Viking has achieved
the deed which Hiördis (Brynhild) demands of the
man who shall wed her; and, again like his heroic
namesake, he has renounced her in favour of his
foster-brother, Gunnar, himself taking another to
wife. This other woman reveals the secret in the
course of an altercation with Hiördis (Brynhild), who,
in consequence of this discovery, brings about Sigurd’s
death and her own. The reader will observe that we
must keep to very general terms if they are to fit
both the saga and the drama. Are there any further
coincidences? Yes, one. After Gudrun has betrayed
the secret, there comes a scene in which she seeks to
appease Brynhild, and begs her to think no more of
it; then follows a scene in which Sigurd explains to
Brynhild how it all happened; and finally a scene in
which Brynhild goads Gunnar to kill Sigurd. All
these scenes have their parallels in the third act of
<cite>The Vikings</cite>; but their order is different, and none of
their wording has been adopted.” From the family-sagas,
again, not only the stature of the characters,
so to speak, but several details of incident and dialogue
are borrowed. The boasting-match at Gunnar’s
feast, which, as we have seen, was one of the first
elements of the story to present itself to Ibsen’s
mind, has many analogies in Icelandic lore. Örnulf’s
questions as to how Thorolf fell are borrowed from
<cite>Egils Saga</cite>, and so is the idea of his “drapa,” or
funeral chant over his dead sons. Sigurd and Hiördis
are, perhaps, almost as closely related to Kiartan and
Gudrun in the <cite>Laxdæla Saga</cite> as to Sigurd Fafnir’s bane
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>and Brynhild. Indeed, Ibsen seems to have
reckoned too confidently on the unfamiliarity of his
public with the stores of material upon which he drew.
Not, of course, that there could be any question of
plagiarism. The sagas were as legitimately at Ibsen’s
service as were Plutarch and Holinshed at Shakespeare’s.
But having been himself, as he tells us,
almost ignorant of the existence of these sagas until
he came across N. M. Petersen’s translation of them
he forgot that people who had long known and loved
them might resent the removal of this trait and that
from its original setting, and might hold it to be, in
its new context, degraded and sentimentalised. “It
may be,” writes H. H. Boyesen, in his generally
depreciatory remarks on the play, “that my fondness
for these sagas themselves prevents me from relishing
the modification and remoulding to which Ibsen has
subjected them.” Dr. Brandes, too, points to a particular
instance in which the sense of degradation
could not but be felt. The day-dream as to the hair-woven
bowstring which Hiördis relates to Sigurd in
the third act (p. <a href='#Page_84'>84</a>) is in itself effective enough; but
any one who knows the splendid passage in <cite>Nials
Saga</cite>, on which it is founded, cannot but feel that the
actual (or at any rate legendary) event is impoverished
by being dragged in under the guise of a mere morbid
fantasy.</p>

<p class='c015'>On the whole, I think Ibsen can scarcely escape the
charge of having sentimentalised the sagas in the
same way, though not in the same degree, in which
Tennyson has sentimentalised the Arthurian legends.
Indeed, Sigurd the Strong is not without points of
resemblance to the Blameless King of the <cite>Idylls</cite>.
But, for my part, I cannot regard this as a very
serious charge. <cite>The Vikings</cite> is the work of a man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>still young (29), who had, moreover, developed very
slowly. It is still steeped in romanticism, though
not in the almost boyish lyricism of its predecessors.
The poet is not yet intellectually mature—very far
from it. But here, for the first time, we are unmistakably
face to face with a great imagination and a
specifically dramatic endowment of the first order.
The germs of promise discernible in <cite>Lady Inger</cite> have
ripened into rare technical mastery.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ibsen was doubtless right in feeling that the superhuman
figures of the mythical sagas were impossible
on the non-musical stage, just as Wagner was right in
feeling that the world of myth could be embodied only
in an atmosphere of music. The reduction, then, of the
Volsungs and Niblungs to the stature of the men of
the family-sagas was not only judicious, but necessary.
But was it judicious to go to the myth-sagas for the
initial idea of a play which had to be developed in
terms of the family-sagas? Scarcely, I think. The
weak points in the structure of the story are precisely
those at which the poet has had to replace supernatural
by natural machinery. To slay a dragon and to break
through a wall of fire, even with magical aid, are exploits
which we can accept, on the mythic plane, as
truly stupendous. But it is impossible to be really
impressed by the slaying of Hiördis’s bear, or to share
in the breathless admiration with which that achievement
is always mentioned. If the bear is to be regarded
as a fabulous monster, it might just as well be
a dragon at once; if it is to be accepted as a real
quadruped, the killing of it is no such mighty matter.
We feel it, in fact, to be a mere substitute, a more or
less ludicrous makeshift. And in the same way,
Sigurd’s renunciation of Hiördis becomes very difficult
to accept when all supernatural agency—magic potion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>or other sleight of wizardry—is eliminated. We feel
that he behaves like a nincompoop in despairing of
winning her for himself, merely because she does not
show an obviously “coming on” disposition, and like
an immoral sentimentalist in handing her over to
Gunnar. This, to be sure, is the poet’s own criticism
of his action. It is the lie which Sigurd and Gunnar
conspire to tell, or rather to enact, that lies at the root
of the whole tragedy. We have here Ibsen’s first
treatment of the theme with which he is afterwards so
much concerned—the necessity of truth as the basis
of every human relation. Gunnar’s acquiescence in
Sigurd’s heroic mendacity is as clearly condemned and
punished as, in <cite>Pillars of Society</cite>, Bernick’s acquiescence
in Johan’s almost equally heroic self-sacrifice.
Both plays convey a warning against excesses of
altruism, and show that we have no right to offer sacrifices
which the person benefiting by them has no right
to accept. But to indicate a correct moral judgment
of Sigurd’s action is not to make it psychologically
plausible. We feel, I repeat, that the poet is trying
in vain to rationalise a series of actions which are
comprehensible only on the supernatural plane.</p>

<p class='c015'>This unreality of plot involved a similar unreality,
or at any rate extreme simplicity, of characterisation.
All the personages are drawn in large, obvious traits,
which never undergo the smallest modification. Sigurd
is throughout the magnanimous hero, Dagny the submissive,
amiable wife, Hiördis the valkyrie-virago,
Gunnar the well-meaning weakling, not cowardly but
inefficient. By far the most human and most individual
figure is old Örnulf, in whom the spirit of the
family-sagas is magnificently incarnated. We feel
throughout the inexperience of the author, his
incuriousness of half-tones in character, his tendency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>to view human relations and problems in a purely sentimental
light. To compare Hiördis with Hedda Gabler,
Sigurd with Halvard Solness, is to realise what an
immeasurable process of evolution the poet was
destined to go through. Indeed, we as yet seem far
enough off even from Duke Skule and Bishop Nicholas.</p>

<p class='c015'>But the man of inventive imagination and the man
of the theatre are already here in all their strength.
Whatever motives and suggestions Ibsen found in the
sagas, the construction of the play is all his own and
is quite masterly. Exposition, development, the
carrying on of the interest from act to act—all this is
perfect in its kind. The play is “well-made” in the
highest sense of the word. Already the poet shows
himself consummate in his art of gradually lifting veil
after veil from the past, and making each new discovery
involve a more or less striking change in the
relations of the persons on the stage. But it is not
technically alone that the play is great. The whole
second act is a superbly designed and modulated piece
of drama; and, for pure nobility and pathos, the scene
of Örnulf’s return—entirely of the poet’s own invention—is
surely one of the greatest things in dramatic
literature. It is marvellous that even æsthetic prejudice
should have prevented a man like J. L. Heiberg
from recognising that he was here in presence of a
great poet. The interest of the third act is mainly
psychological, and the psychology, as we have seen, is
neither very profound nor very convincing. But the
fourth act, again, rises to a great height of romantic
impressiveness. Whatever hints may have come from
the sagas, the picture of Örnulf’s effort of self-mastery
is a very noble piece of work; and the plunge into
supernaturalism at the close, in the child’s vision of
Asgårdsreien, with his mother leading the rout, seems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>to me an entirely justified piece of imaginative daring.
I cannot even agree with Dr. Brandes in condemning
as “Geheimniskrämerei” Sigurd’s dying revelation of
the fact that he is a Christian. It seems to me to harmonise
entirely with the whole sentimental colouring
of the play. The worst flaws I find in this act are
the terrible asides placed in the mouths of Gunnar
and Dagny after the discovery of Sigurd’s death.</p>

<p class='c017'>The word <cite>Vikings</cite> in the title is a very free rendering
of <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><i>Hærmændene</i></span>, which simply means “warriors.” As
“warriors,” however, is a colourless word, and as
Örnulf, Sigurd, and Gunnar all are, or have been,
actually vikings, the substitution seemed justifiable. I
would beg, however hopelessly, that “viking” should
be pronounced so as to rhyme <em>not</em> with “liking” but
with “seeking,” or at worst with “kicking.” Helgeland,
it may be mentioned, is a province or district in
the north of Norway.</p>

<p class='c015'>Örnulf’s “drapa” and his snatches of verse are
rhymed as well as alliterated in the original. I had
the less hesitation in suppressing the rhyme, as it was
actually foreign to the practice of the skalds.</p>

    <div><span class='large'>INTRODUCTION.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Six years elapsed between the composition of <cite>The
Vikings</cite> and that of <cite>The Pretenders</cite>.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c016'><sup>[3]</sup></a> In the interval
Ibsen wrote <cite>Love’s Comedy</cite>, and brought all the world
of Norwegian philistinism, and (as we should now say)
suburbanism, about his ears. Whereas hitherto his
countrymen had ignored, they now execrated him. In
his autobiographic letter of 1870, to Peter Hansen, he
wrote: “The only person who at that time approved
of the book was my wife.... My countrymen excommunicated
me. All were against me. The fact
that all were against me—that there was no longer any
one outside my own family circle of whom I could
say ‘He believes in me’—must, as you can easily see,
have aroused a mood which found its outlet in <cite>The
Pretenders</cite>.” It is to be noted that this was written
during a period of estrangement from Björnson. I do
not know what was Björnson’s attitude towards <cite>Love’s
Comedy</cite> in particular; but there can be no doubt that,
in general, he believed in and encouraged his brother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>poet, and employed his own growing influence in efforts
to his advantage. In representing himself as standing
quite alone, Ibsen probably forgets, for the moment,
his relation to his great contemporary.</p>

<p class='c015'>Yet the relation to Björnson lay at the root of the
character-contrast on which <cite>The Pretenders</cite> is founded.
Ibsen always insisted that each of his plays gave poetic
form to some motive gathered from his own experience
or observation; and this is very clearly true of the
present play. Ever since <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Synnöve Solbakken</cite></span> had
appeared in 1857, Björnson, the expansive, eloquent,
lyrical Björnson, had been the darling child of fortune.
He had gone from success to success unwearied. He
was recognised throughout Scandinavia (in Denmark
no less than in Norway) as the leader of the rising
generation in almost every branch of imaginative
literature. He was full, not only of inspiration and
energy, but of serene self-confidence. Meanwhile
Ibsen, nearly five years older than he, had been pursuing
his slow and painful course of development in comparative
obscurity, in humiliating poverty, and amid almost
complete lack of appreciation. “Mr. Ibsen is a great
cipher” (or “nullity”) wrote a critic in 1858; another,
in 1863, laid it down that “Ibsen has a certain technical
and artistic talent, but nothing of what can be
called ‘genius.’” The scoffs of the critics, however,
were not the sorest trials that he had to bear. What was
hardest to contend against was the doubt as to his own
poetic calling and election that constantly beset him.
This doubt could not but be generated by the very
tardiness of his mental growth. We see him again
and again (in the case of <cite>Olaf Liliekrans</cite>, of <cite>The
Vikings</cite>, of <cite>Love’s Comedy</cite>, and of <cite>The Pretenders</cite> itself),
conceiving a plan and then abandoning it for years—no
doubt because he found himself, in one respect or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>another, unripe for its execution. Every such experience
must have involved for him days and weeks of
fruitless effort and discouragement. To these moods
of scepticism as to his own powers he gave expression
in a series of poems (for the most part sonnets) published
in 1859 under the title of <cite>In the Picture Gallery</cite>.
In it he represents the “black elf” of doubt, whispering
to him: “Your soul is like the dry bed of a mountain
stream, in which the singing waters of poetry have
ceased to flow. If a faint sound comes rustling down
the empty channel, do not imagine that it portends
the return of the waters—it is only the dry leaves
eddying before the autumn wind, and pattering among
the barren stones.” In those years of struggle and
stress, of depressing criticism, and enervating self-criticism,
he must often have compared his own lot
and his own character with Björnson’s, and perhaps,
too, wondered whether there were no means by which
he could appropriate to himself some of his younger
and more facile brother-poet’s kingly self-confidence.
For this relation between two talents he partly found
and partly invented a historic parallel in the relation
between two rival pretenders to the Norwegian throne,
Håkon Håkonsson and Skule Bårdsson.</p>

<p class='c015'>Dr. Brandes, who has admirably expounded the
personal element in the genesis of this play, compares
Håkon-Björnson and Skule-Ibsen with the Aladdin
and Nureddin of Oehlenschläger’s beautiful dramatic
poem. Aladdin is the born genius, serene, light-hearted,
a trifle shallow, who grasps the magic lamp
with an unswerving confidence in his right to it. (“It
is that which the Romans called <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ingenium</i></span>” says Bishop
Nicholas, “truly I am not strong in Latin; but ’twas
called <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ingenium</i></span>.”) Nureddin, on the other hand, is
the far profounder, more penetrating, but sceptical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>and self-torturing spirit. When at last he seizes
Aladdin’s lamp, as Skule annexes Håkon’s king’s
thought, his knees tremble, and it drops from his
grasp, just as the Genie is ready to obey him.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is needless to cite the passages from the scenes
between Skule and Bishop Nicholas in the second act,
Skule and Håkon in the third, Skule and Jatgeir in
the fourth, in which this element of personal symbolism
is present. The reader will easily recognise
them, while recognising at the same time that their
dramatic appropriateness, their relevance to the historic
situation as the poet viewed it, is never for a moment
impaired. The underlying meaning is never allowed
to distort or denaturalise the surface aspect of the
picture.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c016'><sup>[4]</sup></a> The play may be read, understood, and fully
appreciated, by a person for whom this underlying
meaning has no existence. One does not point it out
as an essential element in the work of art, or even as
adding to its merit, but simply as affording a particularly
clear instance of Ibsen’s method of interweaving
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wahrheit</span>” with “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Dichtung</span>.”</p>

<p class='c015'>So early as 1858, soon after the completion of <cite>The
Vikings</cite>, Ibsen had been struck by the dramatic
material in <cite>Håkon Håkonsson’s Saga</cite>, as related by
Snorri Sturlasson’s nephew, Sturla Thordsson, and
had sketched a play on the subject. At that time,
however, he put the draft aside. It was only as the
years went on, as he found himself “excommunicated”
after <cite>Love’s Comedy</cite>, and as the contrast between
Björnson’s fortune and his became ever more marked,
that the figures of Skule and Håkon took more and
more hold upon his imagination. In June 1863, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv'>xxiv</span>attended a “Festival of Song” at Bergen, and there
met Björnson, who had been living abroad since
1860. Probably under the stimulus of this meeting
he set to work upon <cite>The Pretenders</cite> immediately on
his return to Christiania, and wrote it with almost
incredible rapidity. The manuscript went to the
printers in September; the book was published in
October 1863 (though dated 1864), and the play was
produced at the Christiania Theatre, under the author’s
own supervision, on January 17, 1864. The production
was notably successful; yet no one seems fully to have
realised what it meant for Norwegian literature. Outside
of Norway, at any rate, it awoke no echo. George
Brandes declares that scarcely a score of copies of the
play found their way to Denmark. Not until Ibsen
had left Norway (April 1864) and had taken the
Danish reading public by storm with <cite>Brand</cite> and <cite>Peer
Gynt</cite>, did people go back upon <cite>The Pretenders</cite> and
discover what an extraordinary achievement it was.
In January 1871, it was produced at the Royal
Theatre, Copenhagen, where Emil Poulsen found in
Bishop Nicholas one of the great triumphs of his
career. It was produced by the Meiningen Company
and at the Munich Hoftheater in 1875, in Stockholm
in 1879, at the Königliches Schauspielhaus, Berlin, and
at the Vienna Burgtheater in 1891; and it has from
time to time been acted at many other Scandinavian
and German theatres. The character of Nicholas has
fascinated many great actors: what a pity that it did
not come in the way of Sir Henry Irving when he was
at the height of his power! But of course no English
actor-manager would dream of undertaking a character
which dies in the middle of the third act.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ibsen’s treatment of history in this play may be
proposed as a model to other historic dramatists.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv'>xxv</span>Although he has invented a great deal, his inventions
supplement rather than contradict the records. Chronology,
indeed, he treats with considerable freedom,
and at the same time with ingenious vagueness. The
general impression one receives in reading the play is
that the action covers a space of four or five years; as
a matter of fact it covers twenty-two years, between
the folkmote in Bergen, 1218, and Skule’s death, 1240.
All the leading characters are historical; and although
much is read into them which history does not warrant,
there is little that history absolutely forbids us to conceive.
The general features of the struggle between the
two factions—Håkon’s Birkebeiner, or Birchlegs, and
Skule’s Vargbælgs—are correctly enough reproduced.
In his treatment of this period, the Norwegian historian,
J. E. Sars, writing thirteen years after the
appearance of <cite>The Pretenders</cite>, uses terms which might
almost have been suggested by Ibsen’s play. “On the
one side,” he says, “we find strength and certainty, on
the other lameness and lack of confidence. The old
Birchlegs<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c016'><sup>[5]</sup></a> go to work openly and straightforwardly,
like men who are immovably convinced of the justice
of their cause, and unwaveringly assured of its ultimate
victory. Skule’s adherents, on the other hand, are
ever seeking by intrigues and chicanery to place
stumbling-blocks in the way of their opponents’ enthusiasm.”
Håkon represented Sverre’s ideal of a
democratic kingship, independent of the oligarchy of
bishops and barons. “He was,” says Sars, “reared in
the firm conviction of his right to the Throne; he grew
up among the veterans of his grandfather’s time, men
imbued with Sverre’s principles, from whom he accepted
them as a ready-made system, the realisation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvi'>xxvi</span>of which could only be a question of time. He stood
from the first in a clear and straightforward position
to which his whole personality corresponded.... He
owed his chief strength to the repose and equilibrium
of mind which distinguished him, and had its root in
his unwavering sense of having right and the people’s
will upon his side.” His great “king’s-thought,”
however, seems to be an invention of the poet’s.
Skule, on the other hand, represented the old nobility
in its struggle against the new monarchy. “He was
the centre of a hierarchic aristocratic party; but after
its repeated defeats this party must have been lacking
alike in number and in confidence.... It was clear
from the first that his attempt to reawaken the old
wars of the succession in Norway was undertaken in
the spirit of the desperate gambler, who does not
count the chances, but throws at random, in the blind
hope that luck may befriend him.... Skule’s enterprise
had thus no support in opinion or in any prevailing
interest, and one defeat was sufficient to crush
him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>In the character of Bishop Nicholas, too, Ibsen has
widened and deepened his historical material rather
than poetised with a free hand. “Bishop Nicholas,”
says Sars, “represented rather the aristocracy ...
than the cloth to which he belonged. He had begun
his career as a worldly chieftain, and, as such, taken
part in Magnus Erlingsson’s struggles with Sverre;
and although he must have had some tincture of
letters, since he could contrive to be elected a bishop
... there is no lack of indications that his spiritual
lore was not of the deepest. During his long participation
in the civil broils, both under Sverre and later,
we see in him a man to whose character any sort of
religious or ecclesiastical enthusiasm must have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvii'>xxvii</span>foreign, his leading motives being personal ambition
and vengefulness rather than any care for general
interests—a cold and calculating nature, shrewd but
petty and without any impetus, of whom Håkon
Håkonsson, in delivering his funeral speech ...
could find nothing better to say than that he had not
his equal in worldly wisdom (<span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><i>veraldar vit</i></span>).” I cannot
find that the Bishop played any such prominent part
in the struggle between the King and the Earl as
Ibsen assigns to him, and the only foundation for the
great death-bed scene seems to be the following passage
from <cite>Håkon Håkonsson’s Saga</cite>, Cap. 138: “As
Bishop Nicholas at that time lay very sick, he sent a
messenger to the King praying him to come to him.
The King had on this expedition seized certain
letters, from which he gathered that the Bishop
had not been true to him. With this he upbraided
him, and the Bishop, confessing it, prayed
the King to forgive him. The King replied that
he did so willingly, for God’s sake; and as he
could discern that the Bishop lay near to death,
he abode with him until God called him from the
world.”</p>

<p class='c015'>In the introduction to <cite>The Vikings at Helgeland</cite> I
have suggested that in that play Ibsen had reached
imaginative and technical maturity, but was as yet
intellectually immature. The six years that elapsed
between <cite>The Vikings</cite> and <cite>The Pretenders</cite> placed him
at the height of his intellectual power. We have
only to compare Skule, Håkon, and Bishop Nicholas
with Gunnar, Sigurd, and Örnulf to feel that we have
passed from nobly-designed and more or less animated
waxworks to complex and profoundly-studied human
beings. There is no Hiördis in <cite>The Pretenders</cite>, and
the female character-drawing is still controlled by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxviii'>xxviii</span>purely romantic ideals;<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c016'><sup>[6]</sup></a> but how exquisitely human
is Margrete in comparison with the almost entirely
conventional Dagny! The criticism of life, too, which
in <cite>The Vikings</cite> is purely sentimental, here becomes
intense and searching. The only point of superiority
in <cite>The Vikings</cite>—if it be a point of superiority—is
purely technical. The action of the earlier play is
concentrated and rounded. It has all the “unity,”
or “unities,” that a rational criticism can possibly
demand. In a word, it is, in form as well as essence,
an ideal tragedy. <cite>The Pretenders</cite>, on the other hand,
is a chronicle-play, far more close-knit than Shakespeare’s
or Schiller’s works in that kind, but, nevertheless,
what Aristotle would call “episodic” in its
construction. The weaving of the plot, however, is
quite masterly, betokening an effort of invention
and adjustment incomparably greater than that
which went to the making of <cite>The Vikings</cite>. It
was doubtless his training in the school of French
intrigue that enabled Ibsen to depict with such
astonishing vigour that master wire-puller, Bishop
Nicholas. This form of technical dexterity he
was afterwards to outgrow and bring into disrepute.
But from <cite>The Vikings</cite> to <cite>Pillars of
Society</cite> he practised, whenever he was writing primarily
for the stage, the methods of the “well-made
play”; and in everything but concentration, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxix'>xxix</span>the very nature of the subject excluded, <cite>The Pretenders</cite>
is thoroughly “well-made.”</p>

<p class='c015'>With this play, though the Scandinavian criticism of
1864 seems to have been far from suspecting the fact,
Ibsen took his place among the great dramatists of the
world. In wealth of characterisation, complexity and
nobility of emotion, and depth of spiritual insight,
it stands high among the masterpieces of romantic
drama. It would be hard to name a more vigorous
character-projection than that of Bishop Nicholas,
or any one dramatic invention more superbly inspired
than the old man’s death scene, with the triumphant
completion of his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>perpetuum mobile</i></span>. But even if the
Bishop were entirely omitted, the play would not be
<cite>Hamlet</cite> without the Prince of Denmark. The
characters of Håkon and Skule, and the struggle
between them, would still make one of the greatest
historic dramas in literature.</p>

<p class='c015'>It has not been generally noticed, I think, that
Ibsen found in Björnson’s <cite>King Sverre</cite>, published in
1861, a study of Bishop Nicholas in his younger days.
The play, as a whole, is a poor one, and does not
appear in the collected edition of Björnson’s works;
but there is distinct merit in the drawing of the
Bishop’s character. Furthermore, it ought to be
remembered that <cite>The Pretenders</cite> was not the first work,
or even the first great work, of its class in Norwegian
literature. In 1862, Björnson had published his splendid
trilogy of <cite>Sigurd Slembe</cite>, which, though more fluid
and uneven than <cite>The Pretenders</cite>, contains several
passages of almost Shakespearean power. It was
certainly greater than anything Ibsen had done up to
that date. Ibsen reviewed it on its appearance, in
terms of unmixed praise, yet, as one cannot but feel,
rather over-cautiously.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxx'>xxx</span>If anything could excuse the coolness of Norwegian
criticism towards <cite>The Pretenders</cite>, it was the great and
flagrant artistic blemish of the Ghost Scene in the last
act. This outburst of prophetico-topical satire is a
sheer excrescence on the play, indefensible, but, at
the same time, fortunately negligible. It is, however,
of interest as a symptom of Ibsen’s mood in the last
months before he left Norway, and also as one of the
links in that chain which binds all his works together.
Just as Skule’s attempt to plagiarise Håkon’s king’s-thought
points backwards to Gunnar’s moral lapse in
taking advantage of the fraud on Hiördis, so the ironic
rhymes of the Bagler-Bishop’s ghost point forwards
to the lyric indignation and irony of <cite>Brand</cite> and <cite>Peer
Gynt</cite>.</p>

Björnson</cite>; but I may as well give here the substance of the
passage. In the original form of the play, three speeches of
Ingeborg’s, in her scene with Skule, ran as follows: “It is man’s
right to forget,” “It is woman’s happiness to remember,” and
“To have to sacrifice all and be forgotten, that is woman’s
saga.” It was only on Brandes’s remonstrance that Ibsen substituted
the present form of these speeches, in which they
became, not the generalised expression of an ideal, but merely
utterances of Ingeborg’s individual character.</p>

<p class='c015'>That am I, and straightway shall the quarrel be
healed. [<i>To the others.</i>] Be the matter, then,
known to all. Five winters ago came Sigurd and
Gunnar Headman as vikings to Iceland; they lay
in harbour close under my homestead. Then
Gunnar, by force and craft, carried away my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>foster-daughter, Hiördis; but thou, Sigurd, didst
take Dagny, my own child, and sailed with her
over the sea. For that I now doom thee to pay
three hundred pieces of silver, and thereby shall
thy misdeed be atoned.</p>

<p class='c015'>[<i>With suppressed emotion.</i>] No, truly I have

has stayed at home. We made the land here

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>That must I. Listen, Sigurd, for thus it stands:
Last summer I rode to the Council where many
honourable men were met. When the Council-days
were over, I sat in the hall and drank with
the men of my shire, and the talk fell upon the
carrying-away of the women; scornful words they
gave me, because for all these years I had let that
wrong rest unavenged. Then, in my wrath, I
swore to sail to Norway, seek out Gunnar, and
crave reckoning or revenge, and never again to
set foot in Iceland till my claim was made good.</p>

<p class='c015'>It must; but I shall not crave overmuch, and
Gunnar has the fame of an honourable man. I
am glad, too, that I set forth on this quest; the
time lay heavy on me in Iceland; out upon the
blue waters had I grown old and grey, and meseemed
that I must fare forth once again before
I——; well well—Bergthora, my good wife, was
dead these many years; my elder sons sailed on
viking-ventures summer by summer; and since
Thorolf was growing up——</p>

went busily round, and many a great vow was
sworn. I swore to bear away a fair maid with me
from Iceland; Gunnar swore the same as I, and
passed the cup to Hiördis. She grasped it and
stood up, and vowed this vow, that no warrior
should have her to wife, save him who should go to
her bower, slay the white bear that stood bound
at the door, and carry her away in his arms.</p>

<div class='nf-center c022'>

<p class='c015'>When the men left the feast-hall, Gunnar
prayed me to come with him alone to our sleeping-place.
Then said he: “Hiördis is dearer to me
than all women; without her I cannot live.” I
answered him: “Then go to her bower; thou
knowest the vow she hath sworn.” But he said:
“Life is dear to him that loves; if I should assail
the bear, the end were doubtful, and I am loath to
lose my life, for then should I lose Hiördis too.”
Long did we talk, and the end was that Gunnar
made ready his ship, while I drew my sword, took
Gunnar’s harness upon me, and went to the
bower.</p>

<p class='c015'>I slew him. In the bower it was dark as under

women;—what followed, thou knowest; I sailed
from Iceland with a fair maid, as I had sworn, and

<p class='c015'>Ay, we may call them so. At last they came to
Iceland; and there dwelt an old chieftain, who
had come forth from Norway in King Harald’s
days. He had two fair women in his house; but
one, his foster-daughter, was the noblest, for she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>was wise and strong of soul; and the vikings spoke
of her between themselves, and never had they
seen a fairer woman, so deemed they both.</p>

did Sigurd no less; but both held their peace, and
no man could say from her bearing whether Gunnar
found favour in her eyes; but that Sigurd found
none, that was easy to discern.</p>

did that proud woman vow that no man should

which she named. Then high beat Sigurd’s heart
for joy; for he felt within him the strength to do
that deed. But Gunnar took him apart and told

<p class='c015'>I myself can best bear witness to it. Therefore
have I yielded to the counsel of many faithful
friends, and humbled myself as no other chosen
king has done for many a day. I have proved my
birth by the ordeal, proved my right, as the son of
Håkon Sverresson, to succeed to the throne of
Norway. I will not now question who fostered the
doubt, and made it, as the Earl’s kinsman says,
swell into a roar; but this I know, that I have
suffered bitterly under it. I have been chosen
king from boyhood, but little kingly honour has
been shown me, even where it seemed I might look
for it most securely. I will but remind you of last
Palm Sunday in Nidaros,<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c016'><sup>[23]</sup></a> when I went up to the
altar to make my offering, and the Archbishop
turned away and made as though he saw me not,
to escape greeting me as kings are wont to be
greeted. Yet such slights I could easily have
borne, had not open war been like to break loose
in the land; that I must needs hinder.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Then I waited for my brother’s death. He was
sickly from the first; every morning, when we met
at holy mass, I would cast stolen glances to see
whether his sickness increased. Every twitch of
pain that crossed his face was as a puff of wind in
my sails, and bore me nearer to the throne.
Every sigh he breathed in his agony sounded to
me like an echoing trumpet-blast, like a herald
from afar, proclaiming that the throne should soon
be mine. Thus I tore up by the roots every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>thought of brotherly kindness; and Inge died,
and Håkon came—and the Birchlegs made <em class='gesperrt'>him</em>
king.</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Earl Skule.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Methought help must come from above. I felt
the kingly strength within me, and I was growing
old; every day that passed was a day taken
from my life-work. Each evening I thought:
To-morrow will come the miracle that shall strike
him down and set me in the empty seat.</p>

<p class='c015'>Small was then Håkon’s power; he was no

<p class='c015'>Ay, <em class='gesperrt'>there</em> is the rub, Earl Skule,—<em class='gesperrt'>that</em> is the
curse which has lain upon your life. You would
fain know every way open at need,—you dare not
break all your bridges and keep only one, defend
it alone, and on it conquer or fall. You lay snares
for your foe, you set traps for his feet, and hang
sharp swords over his head; you strew poison in
every dish, and you spread a hundred nets for
him; but when he walks into your toils you dare
not draw the string; if he stretch out his hand
for the poison, you think it safer he should fall by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>the sword; if he is like to be caught in the

too mayhap. She was brought to bed secretly in
the house of Trond the Priest, in Heggen parish,
and after nine days she departed homewards; but
the child remained a whole year with the priest,
she not daring to look to it, and none knowing
that it breathed saved Trond and his two sons.</p>

<p class='c015'>Needless to say, ’twas a dangerous task for a
humble priest to rear a king’s child. So soon as
the child was born, he laid the matter before
one of his superiors in the church, and prayed for
his counsel. This his superior bade Trond send
the true king’s son with secrecy to a place of

<p class='c015'>The heavenly bells,—ay, ’tis easy talking when
you still have two stout legs to stand upon.—So
much undone! But much will live after me,
notwithstanding. I promised the Duke by my
soul’s salvation to give him Trond the Priest’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>confession if it came into my hand;—’tis well I
have not got it. Had he certainty, he would
conquer or fall; and then one of the twain would
be the mightiest man that ever lived in Norway.
No no,—what <i>I</i> could not reach none other shall
reach. Uncertainty serves best; so long as the
Duke is burdened with that, they two will waste
each other’s strength, wheresoever they may;
towns will be burnt, dales will be harried,—neither
will gain by the other’s loss—[<i>Terrified.</i>]
Mercy, pity! It is I who bear the guilt—I, who
set it all agoing! [<i>Calming himself.</i>] Well, well,
well! but now the King is coming—’tis he that
suffers most—he will forgive me—prayers and
masses shall be said; there is no danger;—I am
a bishop, and I have never slain any man with
mine own hand.—’Tis well that Trond the Priest’s
confession came not; the saints are with me, they
will not tempt me to break my promise.—Who
knocks at the door? It must be the Duke!
[<i>Rubs his hands with glee.</i>] He will implore me for
proofs as to the kingship,—and I have no proofs
to give him!</p>

It must doubtless be heaven’s will that I should
reconcile the King and the Duke, since it sends
me Trond’s letter now. This is a hard thing,
Nicholas; to tear down at a single wrench what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>you have spent your life in building up. But
there is no other way; I must e’en do the will of
heaven this time.—If I could only read what is
written in the letter! But I cannot see a word!
Mists drive before my eyes; they sparkle and
flicker; and I dare let none other read it for me!
To make such a promise——! Is human cunning,
then, so poor a thing that it cannot govern the
outcome of its contrivances in the second and
third degree? I spoke so long and so earnestly
to Vegard Væradal about making the King send
Inga from him, that at length it came to pass.
That was wise in the first degree; but had I not
counselled thus, then Inga had not now been at
Varteig, the letter had not come into my hands in
time, and I had not had any promise to keep—therefore
’twas unwise in the second degree. Had
I yet time before me——! but only the space of
one night, and scarce even that. I must, I will
live longer! [<i>Knocks with his crozier; a priest

<p class='c015'>Ay, my sight is dim; I scarce can see you where
you stand; but before my inward eye, my life
is moving in a blaze of light. <em class='gesperrt'>There</em> I see
sights——; hear and learn, O King!—My race
was the mightiest in the land; many great
chieftains had sprung from it; <i>I</i> longed to be
the greatest of them all. I was yet but a boy
when I began to thirst after great deeds; meseemed
I could by no means wait till I were
grown. Kings arose who had less right than I,—Magnus
Erlingsson, Sverre the Priest——; I also
would be king; but I must needs be a chieftain
first. Then came the battle at Ilevoldene; ’twas
the first time I went out to war. The sun went
up, and glittering lightnings flashed from a
thousand burnished blades. Magnus and all his
men advanced as to a game; I alone felt a
tightness at my heart. Fiercely our host swept
forward; but I could not follow—I was afraid!
All Magnus’s other chieftains fought manfully,
and many fell in the fight; but I fled up over the
mountain, and ran and ran, and stayed not until
I came down to the fiord again, far away. Many
a man had to wash his bloody clothes in
Trondheim-fiord that night;—I had to wash mine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>too, but not from blood. Ay, King, I was afraid;—born
to be a chieftain—and afraid! It fell
upon me as a thunderbolt; from that hour I
hated all men. I prayed secretly in the churches,
I wept and knelt before the altars, I gave rich
gifts, made sacred promises; I tried and tried in
battle after battle, at Saltösund, at Jonsvoldene
that summer the Baglers lay in Bergen,—but ever
in vain. Sverre it was who first noted it; he
proclaimed it loudly and with mockery, and from
that day forth, not a man in the host but laughed
when Nicholas Arnesson was seen in war-weed.
A coward, a coward—and yet was I filled with
longing to be a chief, to be a king; nay, I felt I
was born to be King. I could have furthered
God’s kingdom upon earth; but ’twas the saints
themselves that barred the way for me.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Ay, I have hated much; hated every head in
this land that raised itself above the crowd. But
I hated because I could not love. Fair women,—oh,
I could devour them even now with glistening
eyes! I have lived eighty years, and yet do I
yearn to kill men and clasp women;—but my lot
in love was as my lot in war: nought but an
itching will, my strength sapped from my birth;
dowered with seething desire—and yet a weakling!
So I became a priest: king or priest must
that man be who would have all might in his
hands. [<i>Laughs.</i>] I a priest! I a churchman!
Yes, for <em class='gesperrt'>one</em> clerkly office Heaven had notably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>fitted me—for taking the high notes—for singing
with a woman’s voice at the great church-festivals.
And yet they up yonder claim of me—the half-man—what
they have a right to claim only of
those whom they have in all things fitted for their
life-work! There have been times when I fancied
such a claim might be just; I have lain here on
my sick-bed crushed by the dread of doom and
punishment. Now it is over; my soul has fresh
marrow in its bones; <i>I</i> have not sinned; it is <i>I</i>
that have suffered wrong; <i>I</i> am the accuser!</p>

Håkon. Oh, God, God! now at last come light and
peace over our house. [<i>Goes out to the right.</i></p>

<p class='c015'>[<i>After a short and gloomy silence.</i>] Håkon has a
son. His race shall live after him. If he die, he
leaves an heir who stands nearer the throne than
all others. All things thrive with Håkon. Mayhap
he is not the rightful king; but his faith in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>himself stands firm as ever; the Bishop would
have shaken it, but Death gave him not time, God
gave him not leave. God watches over Håkon,
and suffers him to keep the girdle of strength.
Were I to tell him now? Were I to make oath
to what the Bishop told me? What would it
avail? None would believe me, neither Håkon
nor the others. He would have believed the
Bishop in the hour of death; the doubt would
have rankled poisonously in him; but it was not
to be. And deep-rooted as is Håkon’s faith, so is
my doubt deep-rooted; what man on earth can
weed it out? None, none. The ordeal has been
endured, God has spoken, and still Håkon may
not be the rightful king, while my life goes to
waste. [<i>Seats himself broodingly beside a table on
the right.</i>] And if, now, I won the kingdom,
would not the doubt dwell with me none the less,
gnawing and wearing and wasting me away, with
its ceaseless icy drip, drip.—Aye; but ’tis better
to sit doubting on the throne than to stand down
in the crowd, doubting of him who sits there in
your stead.—There must be an end between me
and Håkon! An end? But how? [<i>Rises.</i>]
Almighty, thou who hast thus bestead me, thou
must bear the guilt of the issue! [<i>Goes to and
fro, stops and reflects.</i>] I must break down all
bridges, hold only <em class='gesperrt'>one</em>, and there conquer or fall—as
the Bishop said at the bridal-feast at Bergen.
That is now nigh upon three years since, and
through all that time have I split up and spilt my
strength in trying to guard all the bridges. [<i>With
energy.</i>] Now must I follow the Bishop’s counsel;
now or never! Here are we both in Oslo; this
time I have more men than Håkon; why not
seize the advantage—’tis so seldom on my side.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>[<i>Vacillating.</i>] But to-night——? At once——?
No, no! Not to-night! Ha-ha-ha—there
again!—pondering, wavering! Håkon knows not
what that means; he goes straight forward,
and so he conquers! [<i>Going up the room, stops
suddenly beside the cradle.</i>] The King-child!—How
fair a brow! He is dreaming. [<i>Smoothes
out the bed-clothes; and looks long at the child.</i>] Such
an one as thou can save many things in a man’s
soul. I have no son. [<i>Bends over the cradle.</i>] He
is like Håkon——[<i>Shrinks suddenly backwards.</i>]
The King-child, said the Queen! Bow low before
him and hail him as men hail kings! Should
Håkon die before me, this child will be raised to
the throne; and I—I shall stand humbly before
him, and bow low and hail him as king! [<i>In
rising agitation.</i>] This child, Håkon’s son, shall sit
on high, on the seat that should in right, mayhap,
be mine—and I shall stand before his footstool,
white-haired and bowed with age, and see my
whole life-work lying undone—die without having
been king!—I have more men than Håkon—there
blows a storm to-night, and the wind sweeps down
the fiord——!  If I took the King-child? I am
safe with the Trönders.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c016'><sup>[34]</sup></a> What would Håkon
dare attempt, were his child in my power? My
men will follow me, fight for me and conquer.
Their reward shall be kingly, and they know it.—So
shall it be! I will take the stride; I will
leap the abyss, for the first time! Could I but
see if thou hast Sverre’s eyes—or Håkon Sverresson’s——!
He sleeps. I cannot see them. [<i>A
pause.</i>] Sleep is as a shield. Sleep in peace, thou
little Pretender! [<i>Goes over to the table.</i>] Håkon
shall decide; once again will I speak with him.</p>

<p class='c015'>[<i>Waits till the men are gone; the tension of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>his features relaxes; he sinks upon a bench.</i>] How
weary I am, weary to death. To live in the
midst of that swarm day out and day in, to look
smilingly ahead as though I were so immovably
assured of right and victory and fortune. To have
no creature with whom I may speak of all that
gnaws me so sorely. [<i>Rises with a look of terror.</i>]
And the battle at Låka! That I should have
conquered there! Håkon sent his host against
me; God was to judge and award between the
two kings—and I conquered, conquered, as never
any before has conquered the Birchlegs! Their
shields stood upright in the snow, but there was
none behind them—the Birchlegs took to the
woods, and fled over upland and moor and lea as
far as their legs would carry them. The unbelievable
came to pass; Håkon lost and I won.
There is a secret horror in that victory. Thou
great God of Heaven! there rules, then, no certain
law on high, that all things must obey? The
right carries with it no conquering might? [<i>With a
change of tone, wildly.</i>] I am sick, I am sick!—Wherefore
should not the right be on my side?
May I not deem that God himself would assure
me of it, since he let me conquer? [<i>Brooding.</i>]
The possibilities are even;—not a feather-weight
more on the one side than on the other; and yet—[<i>shakes
his head</i>]—yet the balance dips on
Håkon’s part. I have hatred and hot desire to
cast into my scale, yet the balance dips on Håkon’s
part. When the thought of the kingly right comes
over me unawares, ’tis ever he, not I, that is the
true king. When I would see myself as the true
king, I must do it with forethought, I must build
up a whole fabric of subtleties, a work of cunning;
I must hold memories aloof, and take faith by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>storm. It was not so before. What has befallen
to fill me so full of doubt? The burning of the
letter? No—that made the uncertainty eternal,
but did not add to it. Has Håkon done any great
and kingly deed in these later days? No, his
greatest deeds were done while I least believed
in him. [<i>Seats himself on the right.</i>] What is it?
Ha, strange! It comes and goes like a marsh-fire;
it dances at the tip of my tongue, as when one has
lost a word and cannot find it. [<i>Springs up.</i>] Ha!
Now I have it! No——! Yes, yes! Now I have
it!—“Norway has been a <em class='gesperrt'>kingdom</em>, it shall become
a <em class='gesperrt'>people</em>; all shall be one, and all shall feel
and know that they are one!” Since Håkon spoke
those madman’s words, he stands ever before me
as the rightful king. [<i>Whispers with fixed and apprehensive
gaze.</i>] What if God’s calling glimmered
through these strange words? If God had garnered
up the thought till now, and would now
strew it forth—and had chosen Håkon for his
sower?</p>

Håkon. Are there, then, upward as well as downward
steps? Stands Håkon as high over me as I
over Paul Flida? Has Håkon an eye for unborn
thoughts, that is lacking in me? Who stood so
high as Harold Hårfager in the days when every
headland had its king, and he said: Now they
must fall—hereafter shall there be but one? He
threw the old saga to the winds, and made a new
saga. [<i>A pause; he paces up and down lost in thought;
then he stops.</i>] Can one man take God’s calling
from another, as he takes weapons and gold
from his fallen foe? Can a Pretender clothe himself
in a king’s life-task, as he can put on the
kingly mantle? The oak that is felled to be a
ship’s timber, can it say: Nay, I will be the mast,
I will take on me the task of the fir-tree, point
upwards, tall and shining, bear the golden vane
at my top, spread bellying white sails to the sunshine,
and meet the eyes of all men, from afar!—No,
no, thou heavy gnarled oak-trunk, thy place is
down in the keel; <em class='gesperrt'>there</em> shalt thou lie, and do thy
work, unheard-of and unseen by those aloft in the
daylight; it is thou that shalt hinder the ship from
being whelmed in the storm; while the mast with
the golden vane and the bellying sail shall bear it
forward toward the new, toward the unknown,
toward alien strands and the saga of the future!
[<i>Vehemently.</i>] Since Håkon uttered his great
king-thought, I can see no other thought in the
world but that only. If I cannot take it and act it
out, I see no other thought to fight for. [<i>Brooding.</i>]
And can I not make it mine? If I cannot,
whence comes my great love for Håkon’s
thought?</p>

political faction. They were so called because, at the time of
their first appearance, when they seem to have been little more
than bandits, they eked out their scanty attire by making themselves
leggings of birch-bark. Norway at this time swarmed
with factions, such as the “Bagler” or Croziers (Latin, baculus),
so called because Bishop Nicholas was their chief, the Ribbungs,
the Slittungs, etc., devoted, for the most part, to one or other of
the many Pretenders to the crown.</p>

between “court,” “household,” and “guard.” I have
never translated it “court,” as that word seemed to convey an
idea of peaceful civilisation foreign to the country and period;
but I have used either “guard” or “household” as the context
seemed to demand. <i>Hirdmand</i> I have generally rendered
“man-at-arms.” <i>Lendermand</i> I have represented by “baron”;

“marshal”—all mere rough approximations.</p>

<p class='c015'><a href='#r38'>38</a>. The derivation of this word is doubtful. In the form
<i>Vargbælg</i> it means Wolf-skin, from Icelandic <i>Vargr</i> = a wolf,
and <i>Belgr</i>—the skin of an animal taken off whole. The more
common form, however, is <i>Varbelg,</i> which, as P. A. Munch
suggests (“Det Norske Folks Historie,” iii. 219), may possibly
come from <i>var</i> (our word “ware”), a covering, and may be an
allusion to the falsity and cunning of the faction. What Ibsen
understands by the form <i>Vårbælg</i> I cannot discover. <i>Vår</i>
(Icelandic <i>Vâr</i>) means the springtide. The nick-name had been
applied to a political faction as early as 1190, and was merely
revived as a designation for Skule’s adherents.</p>

<p class='c015'>There are quite a few instances of missing punctuation. The
conventional period following the character’s name is sometimes
missing and has been added for consistency’s sake without
further comment. Those missing from setting and stage direction
are also added without comment, since there is no obvious purpose to be
served by the omission. However, the restoration of punctuation
missing from dialogue is noted below, since the punctuation is
frequently expressive.</p>

<p class='c015'>Volume I of this series included errata for each succeeding volume.
Some, but not all of the corrections indicated there had been made

<p class='c015'>Other errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected, and

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
